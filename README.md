## üõí Amazon-Analytics | Power BI

This project showcases an interactive Amazon sales dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard visualizes sales performance across different cities, states, and product categories, offering a clear view of overall business performance.

The goal is to provide meaningful insights into key sales metrics such as total revenue, units sold, and seller performance, with interactive visuals and filters that allow users to explore data at both regional and product levels.

## üîç Dashboard Features:
	‚Ä¢	KPI Cards for overall metrics (total sales, units sold, seller count).
	‚Ä¢	Bar Charts comparing sales by city and state.
	‚Ä¢	Line Chart for sales trends over time.
	‚Ä¢	Interactive Product Catalog with product images and categories.
	‚Ä¢	Product View page showing sales units, revenue, returns, and reviews for each item.
	‚Ä¢	Filters for order status (shipped, pending, cancelled, returned).

This dashboard helps users quickly identify top-performing products, compare regional sales, and track fulfillment performance. It can be useful for business managers, analysts, and stakeholders who need a clear overview of sales operations.

The data was prepared and cleaned in Excel, then loaded into Power BI for modeling and visualization. DAX was used to create calculated measures and KPIs to ensure dynamic analysis.
